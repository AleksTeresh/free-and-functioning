## What's this?

A prototype of an RPG with some strategy elements set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world.

The project features 5 levels of different difficulty, including a boss and a tutorial level. 
The first 3 levels are the very beginning of the game - both in terms of plot and difficulty, 
while 2 other levels feature a full set of abilities of all the 4 characters.

The gameplay idea is to have an experience similar to that of Dota, but where a player controls 
up to 4 characters at the same time. A focus is on having 2 attack modes - single and multi - that
significantly change how characters use their abilities as well as ordinary attacks. Enemy units are 
divided into minor and major, which forces a player to switch between multi and single attack modes 
respectively to defeat the units.

Almost all of the assets including music and UI elements were created from scratch. Currently,  
mouse and keyboard and XBox 360 controller are supported.
