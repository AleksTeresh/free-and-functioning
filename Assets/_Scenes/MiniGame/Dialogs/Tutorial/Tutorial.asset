  - "You select units by clicking at them, or using hot keys. Hot keys are useful,
    since they allow fast selection of units especially when there are a lot of objects
    on the map. Try to select each of the units and order it to relocate.\r"
  - You can select multiple units by holding <Shift> while pressing a hotkey. You
    can also select all units, by pressing <Tilde>. Select all of your units and order
    them to relocate.
  - Notice that the units keep formation when ordered to move together.
  - If you do not like the default formation, you can use custom formation. Press
    <A> to change formation mode to be custom.
  - "Now you\u2019ll have to reposition each unit manually before moving them together.
    When moved together, unit will keep the same position relative to each other."
  - Switch the formation mode to be manual, rearrange your units and send them to
    a new destination.
  - "Change the formation mode to be automatic again. You can see the current formation
    mode in the upper panel on your screen.\r\n"
  - If you need to stop selected units, you can use Stop command by pressing <S> button.
    Try it now. Send your units to a new destination and press <S> while they on their
    way.
  - "Now, let\u2019s try to attack an enemy, click on the enemy you want to attack
    for it to become a target for your units."
  - "Notice that there are 2 attack modes in the game: Single and Multi.\r\nThe indication
    of the current attack mode can be found in the upper left corner of the screen.
    \r"
  - Press <Space> to switch attack mode. In Single attack mode, all the units attack
    a single selected target. In Multi attack mode, Adolf will use its multi-mode
    attack shooting projectiles to all the enemies within its attack range.
  - "Also abilities of the units differ depending on the mode.\r"
  - "To put selected units into \u201CDefence\u201D mode, press <D>. "
  - "The defence mode indicator in the lower left corner turns blue indicating that
    the selected unit is in the defence mode. When in defence mode, units will still
    attack enemies within their attack range, but will not chase them.\r"
  - "To turn off \u201CDefence\u201D mode for selected units, press <D> again.  "
  - 'Abilities can be used by pressing one of the corresponding button: <Q>, <W>,
    <E> or <R>. '
  - When in single mode, the ability will affect current target. When in multi mode,
    the ability will affect all the enemies within its reach.
  - "There are also, \u201CArea of Effect\u201D abilities that affect all the enemy
    units within a certain range around the hero. The range is indicated by a circle
    appearing around the hero for a short time.\r"
  - "Notice that abilities of a hero vary depending on whether you\u2019re in Single
    or Multi attack mode.\r"
  - "For Gendolfine, however, abilities are used differently. Since all the abilities
    that are \ravailable to Gendolfine are targeted to ally units, simply pressing
    one of the abilities hotkeys (q, w, e, r) is not enough.\r"
  - After selecting an ability with a corresponding hotkey, you need to press another
    key that stands for a unit on whom the ability should be applied.
  - 'For example, if you want to heal Adolf, select Gendolfine, press <Q> to select
    healing ability and then press <2> to apply the ability on Adolf. '
  - "Similarly, you can apply an ability to all the ally units, by pressing <Tilde>
    button.\r Try it now!"
  - Finally, all the enemy units can be divided into Minor and Major. While it is
    reasonable to use multi mode attack against minor units, you should use single
    target mode attack against major ones.
  - "Major enemy units are usually very dangerous.\r"
  - Keep you eyes on the unit panels positioned on the left and right of the screen.  On
    the right, you can see overview of your own units -  their health, as well as
    statuses that are currently affect them.
  - On the left, you can see a similar panel indicating current state of major enemies.
  - f you need to change a target to another major unit, you can do so quickly by
    pressing <F> key one or multiple times.
  - "Notice also that the selection indicator on your left-side enemy panel gets changed
    as you press <F>.\r\n"
