  - "You\u2019re sorry! Well, that won't help us much! "
  - 'Alright, there was the warehouse that we passed half an hour ago. So surely there
    is an option to go there and see if we can find anything useful. '
  - "But, first of all, we\u2019ll waste time. Secondly, we never know if there are
    any resources at all. And finally, we have no idea what kind of danger we\u2019re
    putting ourselves in."
  - Nevertheless, I suppose we don't have much choice now...
  - "Adolf, turn around, we\u2019re going back\u2026\r"
