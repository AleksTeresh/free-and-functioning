  dialogSentences:
  - Some say that the world was free once, many generations ago, but it seems a rather
    improbable rumor nowadays.
  - The Evil Organization has established its reign long ago having conquered the
    world almost entirely. Those who disagreed to join were first suppressed - in
    the beginning verbally, then physically - and, in the end, exterminated.
  - 'Those who fled found their shelter in distant, god-forgotten places having to
    live their lives in constant fear of being found and in a continuous struggle
    for resources to survive. '
  - Adolf, Rudolf, and Gendolfine were 3 members of one of such communities of dissidents
    that had been struggling to survive for a long time but eventually ran out of
    resources completely.
  - The three were the last members that remained alive and still functioning. All
    the rest had either have died or were helplessly waiting for their hour to come.
  - Seeing the full extent of the despair of their situation, the three decided to
    do something about it and seek a better place for living.
  - It was not known to them how big a portion of the world remained unconquered by
    the Evil Organization, or if there was even another such community as theirs still
    in existence.
  - "However, there were stories - more like fairy tales - about Free Lands far in
    the South. Having nothing better to do, the three decided to depart for the desperate
    journey.\r"
