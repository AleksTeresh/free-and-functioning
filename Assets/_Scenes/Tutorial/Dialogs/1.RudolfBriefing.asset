  - Alright, as I understand, you two do not have much experience in battles. While
    I do have some, it is pretty limited anyway.
  - We should practice a little before actually departing. There are several basic
    Evil Organization units roaming around. Those are as weak as it gets, so they
    will be a good target for our training.
  - "Now tell me what you actually can do. Josefine, let\u2019s start with you.\r\n"
