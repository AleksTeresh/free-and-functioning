  dialogSentences:
  - You select units by clicking at them, or using hot keys. Hot keys are useful,
    since they allow fast selection of units especially when there are a lot of objects
    on the map. Try to select each of the units and order them to go the red flag.
  - 'You can select multiple units by holding <Shift> while pressing a hotkey. You
    can also select all units, by pressing <Tilde>. Now, select all of your units.

'
  - "Good! Now, order them to go to the red flag. You can see location of the red
    flag from the minimap in the lower right corner of your screen\r."
  - Notice that the units keep formation when ordered to move together. If you do
    not like the default formation, you can use custom formation. Press <A> to change
    formation mode to be custom.
  - "Now you\u2019ll have to reposition each unit manually before moving them together.
    When moved together, unit will keep the same position relative to each other.
    Rearrange your units to a formation you like and send them to the red flag."
  - "Change the formation mode to be automatic again. You can see the current formation
    mode in the upper panel on your screen.\r"
  - If you need to stop selected units, you can use "Stop" command by pressing <S>
    button. Try it now. Send your units to a new destination and press <S> while they
    on their way.
  - "Now, let\u2019s try to attack an enemy. Notice that there are 2 enemy units now
    near the red flag. You can find the flag from the minimap. Click on the enemy
    you want to attack for it to become a target for your units. Then wait till the
    battle is over."
  - "Notice that there are 2 attack modes in the game: Single and Multi.\r The indication
    of the current attack mode can be found in the upper left corner of the screen.
    \rPress <Space> to switch attack mode."
  - In Single attack mode, all the units attack a single selected target. In Multi
    attack mode, Adolf will use its multi-mode attack shooting projectiles at all
    the enemies within its attack range. Move your units closer to the new position
    of the flag, so that the enemies are within their vision range. Notice that your
    units start attacking enemies on their own.
  - "To put selected units into \u201CDefence\u201D mode, press <D>. The defence mode
    indicator in the lower left corner turns blue indicating that the selected unit
    is in defence mode. When in defence mode, units will still attack enemies within
    their attack range, but will not chase them. Put all of your units into defence
    mode and see how they react to passing by enemies"
  - Now wait till the enemies pass your units and note that your units do not chase
    the enemies.
  - "To turn off \u201CDefence\u201D mode for selected units, press <D> again. Disable
    \"Defence\" mode for all of your units."
  - ' Abilities can be used by pressing one of the corresponding button: <Q>, <W>,
    <E> or <R>. When in single mode, the ability will affect a current target. When
    in multi mode, the ability will affect all enemies within its reach. '
  - "For Gendolfine, however, abilities are used differently. Since all the abilities
    that are \ravailable to Gendolfine are targeted to ally units, simply pressing
    one of the abilities hotkeys (q, w, e, r) is not enough.\r After selecting an
    ability with a corresponding hotkey, you need to press another key (1, 2, 3, 4)
    that stands for a unit to whom the ability should be applied."
  - ' For example, to heal Rudolf, select Gendolfine, press <Q> to select healing
    ability and then press <1> to apply the ability on Rudolf.  Now use "Heal" ability
    to heal all the members. You can heal your units one by one, or you can use "Multi
    heal" by pressing <Q> to select the ability first, and then pressing <Tilde> button
    instead of a number, thus targeting all the reachable units.'
  - "There are also \u201CArea of Effect\u201D abilities that affect all the enemies
    within a certain range around a hero. The range is indicated by a circle around
    the hero using the ability.\r Go to the red flag and try to use Rudolf's \"Agro\"
    ability to see how \"Area of Effect\" abilities can be distinguished visually.
    Use Single attack mode or just move units close enough so they start attacking
    themselves"
  - "Finally, all the enemy units can be divided into Minor and Major. Major enemy
    units are usually very dangerous.\r While it is reasonable to use multi mode attack
    against minor units, you should use single target mode attack against major ones."
  - Keep you eyes on the unit panels positioned on the left and right of the screen.  On
    the right, you can see overview of your own units -  their health, as well as
    statuses that are currently affecting them. On the left, you can see a similar
    panel indicating current state of major enemies.
  - " If you need to change a target to another major unit, you can do so quickly
    by pressing <F> key one or multiple times. Try it now, switch the major target
    by pressing <F>. Notice also that the selection indicator on your left-side enemy
    panel gets changed as you press <F>.\r"
  - That's about it for this tutorial. Now its time to start the journey!
